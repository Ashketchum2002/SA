All in all, a great two bedroom apartment. Bigger than expected and has great TV if that is your calling. Food places a little lean on that side, but China town nearby if that is your cuisine, otherwise walk to George street and then taste some of the other restaurants at the hotels and near the Circular Quay

", 10 ,"Text: this was my second stay in less than a week. My first stay was perfect but the checking in process this tIme round was very protracted and the room I was assigned this second time around was a lot smaller and had the wrong bed configuration. When we discovered this we tried calling on the phone to reception but none of the buttons worked so I had to go down to reception to sort it out. I was really unhappy as we had had a tiring journey and were rushing to get to another appointment. The front desk gentlemen Nick, Vincent and Izzy were really professional and kept their cool when I voiced my displeasure. I must commend them highly for their unfailing courtesy and outstanding service recovery which turned around an experience that had the potential to spoil our holiday. They were operating at full capacity with a reduced staff strength so to remain unflappable and maintain the highest standards of service was a real achievement. Well done guys!",no daily servicing,en

great room, great location
awesome views of the city and darling Harbour 
staff at check in and check out were great","customer service took ages answering the phone- sometimes it took a few tries before they answer the phone
room didn’t have any dishwashing capsule/ soap, toilet paper in both bathrooms only had 1/4-1/3 left, and didn’t have spare toilet paper. 
no extra plastic bags for the rubbish (and the rubbish shoot requires the waste to be in bags) - the issue was that it was a pain to ask customer service for these things, as they took ages to answer the call
customer service were probably very busy writing our stay due to the changes in covid protocol. hoping service improves next time we stay, as we really liked the apartment and location. 
lastly someone opened the front door (most probably a staff), in the morning, on our last day at the hotel without knocking. there was no room service or cleaning during short stays due to covid, so not sure why staff would try to access the room. the person closed the door when they he/she realized the room was occupied",en

We weren't able to have our apartment serviced despite staying for 6 days, and didn't receive compensation in some way for this. As a result, we had to wash and dry our own towels, and clean our own apartment- something guests always look forward to having done by staff on a holiday. 
The security guards at night time were inconsistent. On New Years Day at approximately 2:00am we were not asked for proof of stay in order to go into the building and were able to simply walk through- whilst a police incident was occurring outside. Meanwhile on a separate night at approximately 11:00pm, the security guard asked for our key as proof of our stay at the hotel. This made us concerned and unsafe as to who can come and go into the hotel at night due to the inconsistency.",en

", 8.0 ,We loved our stay in Meriton.The staff were so friendly and helpful. Everytime we walked into Meriton Suites  the foyer smelled amazing. It was so refreshing. The room was lovely and very clean. We really loved the location as Darling Harbour and all the shops and lots of restaurants and cafes and town hall  were only walking distance away. We have booked again with Meriton as we are going to see Hamilton at the lyrics! So happy to be coming back to Meriton Suites! ❤️,Just needed to mention a few things that need to be looked at. The pillows were uncomfortable and I woke up with a sore neck.The mattress was comfy but sitting on the edge of the bed was not stable. A few extra towels would be nice and maybe some disposable earplugs would be nice as well as you can here sometimes noisy neighbours. I noticed we did not have any complimentary water bottles. Also in the suite there was coffee and tea available which was nice but no milk which I found was strange.,en

Also lighting above vanity is poor for applying makeup. In other 4 and 5 star hotels they have a makeup/ shaving mirror and at least one full length mirror you can check your outfit in.

The biggest negative was not allowing people to use the hotel's wifi on the hotel's tvs.
It made no sense - we could use the hotel wifi to do anything on our own devices, but not on the provided tvs. 
We ended up having to use a month's worth of mobile data in one day just to access Netflix on the tvs. 
It made the advertising of 'unlimited wifi' feel a little misleading.

Appreciate just opened but the teething issues and details re room stocks should be sorted by now. Not that I care but it does impact on the overall impression, paint work on roof shoddy, missed paint around light fixtures and kitchen drawer paint chipped already. Hard cold tile floor in living room makes for an uncomfortable living room experience. Slippers should be provided in each room, rather than having to request. I stayed at north sydney Meriton 1 week prior to staying here and I feel it is a better stay, better views onto the harbour and takes only 5 mins by train to get into cbd.

", 4.0 ,I actually really liked the location and the hotel itself. The staff were pleasant and somewhat accommodating. They were very knowledgeable about the area,"I’m sorry Meriton, I did think about this for some time before posting this review. I was there to work and was disrupted repeatedly by unsupervised children who, upon being told to please keep the noise down decided to swear repeatedly at me and call me every F word combination under the sun, all the while pointing their finger in my face saying “you’re too f’ing sensitive and it’s not my problem you have to work. We can do whatever we want!” While the staff did move me to a better room, this should have never happened and the guests should have been removed from the hotel for verbally abusing me, disrupting  my work and allowing children to remain unsupervised. This, I feel, was handled incredibly poorly because even though I moved rooms (I did receive an upgrade, thank you) I was left feeling stressed out and completely unheard. It’s really disgraceful you allow this type of behaviour to run rampant in your hotel (and yes, by the way, swearing at someone in an abusive way is consideration for a civil offence and they are lucky I didn’t take matters further with the parents). That’s a horrible and compromising position you put me in, Meriton and it will never be okay because what you’ve done is say yes to bad behaviour and poor quality guests.",en

More to the point I can't say I was overwhelmed with the cleanliness of the apartment. Some tables and benches seem not be have wiped down: a little dirty.

It really made me angry because they could have just let me stay in the room i had and give some othe client (maybe a loyal client) an upgrade. could have saved me unpacking´and packing my stuff twice and saved them cleaning a huge room for just 1 night. loyal client happy because of upgrade. totally unnecessary and not to appreciate.

No teatowels in room to dry dishes. No straightners as advertised and too late once in bathroom to travel downstairs to ask and phone didnt work. Wardrobe door off its runners so wouldnt glide. All a bit annoying as paid alot of money for luxury. View was limited to buildings. We were too low to see harbour. Luck of the draw. No offer of room upgrade as room was not ready or to quality standard on arrival.even though I had to complain and have it recleaned. Ie. Toiletries still in bathroom bin. Surfaces not clean but products were replenished so house keeping had attended, just done bad job.. Big covid risk for us which ruined our start of stay.

All showed I booked exactly the same rooms.  So I brought my laptop downstairs to the reception, and showed to the reception staff that I should not be arranged to a smaller room.  The same room descriptions via booking.com are different in Chinese and English, this is why if haven't had the chance to check both languages, you will think you booked different rooms but pay the same, and even higher in my 2nd booking.

Once we got back to the hotel room I took a shower only for the floor to be covered in water and drain not working and once again rang and rang the front of house with no answer. Once I told the staff at the hotel in the morning I was told I should of come down to the front and requested it which I find unacceptable once I was not getting a reply on the phone I presumed their was no staff downstairs, I was also not told on check-in any details of anything to help my stay easier and how this horrible stay could of been avoided",en

I had no need to use the restaurant, but still they would not allow me accomodation. I will never give them my business again and will tell all my friends how badly I was treated.

It took an hour for us to reach the front, where they told us our room wasn’t ready, as it hadn’t been cleaned (no rooms were ready), when asked how long it would be, we were told “not sure, maybe half and hour”. They said we could wait in the lobby, or they could call us when our room was ready, we said please call. We didn’t get a call, but returned at 5.30 and our room still wasn’t ready. We had somewhere to be, so we went on with our plans. No one ever called us, we returned after midnight and thankfully the room was ready. However, when we got to our room, the door was open and unlocked, and the room was ok, but certainly not cleaned to a high standard. We were given a small discount for the trouble, but really all we wanted was to be able to shower and get ready in the room we had booked and paid for.
The service was beyond terrible, the front desk staff weren’t even sympathetic. I would dread having to stay here again.",en

", 10 ,"The staff are absolutely amazing and the room was just gorgeous. we came for Vivid as an early birthday present for my 6 year old. We had the opera house and bridge to look at through the window and we could watch all the lights, which looked amazing. 
On arrival in my room the staff organised a birthday cake and treat for my son which he just loved and even a treat for me, which was awesome.
The next day we spent the morning up at the pool and my son didn’t want to leave this area. The staff were so helpful with him and helped me to the room with our stuff and even carried him there. They were so understanding and non judgemental, as he suffers from ADHD and was in a big meltdown.
They even came to the room later with another treat for him to make sure he was feeling better.
This hotel went above and beyond to make our stay the best we could possibly have.
I have stayed here twice when it was the regent a while back and this was my 2nd time staying here, and it just gets better and better. 
I highly recommend staying here when coming to sydney. 
It’s a short stroll to the opera house and bridge and you have Mcdonalds, and other fast food cafes and restaurants across the road also.","Nothing, the staff were amazing from our arrival to the moment we left.

", 8.0 ,The location and views are incredible. The room was very comfortable and clean. Staff was lovely and very helpful.,Reception couldn’t find my booking they said it was a problem with Booking.com. It was disappointing because the reason of our stay was a surprise anniversary celebration. I spoke to someone in the hotel through the Booking.com system on the days before our arrival saying it was our anniversary and thought something especial would be waiting for us. A simple bottle of champagne would be super appreciated but instead we spent 20min on our arrival trying to find our booking at reception.,en

More important was the service in the restaurant for breakfast. We were sat down by a staff member who took off before we could ask the tea/coffee procedure. We then spent some time trying to find how we go about it, finally gave our order to a staff member and after 20 minutes, hadn't arrived, so requested again. No-one told us you had to order the eggs seperately, so ordered up at the counter, these eggs never arrived, so missed out there.

The bed is very soft and luxurious, and we both loved it, though not sure we could sleep on it long term, we personally prefer a slightly firmer bed, but that isn't a complaint, the soft plush bed for a weekend away with a real treat.  The lounge chair along the window is a really nice place to sit.   
We didn't use the pool, bars, restaurants, etc, so can only comment on the room, and very happy with it.","I'm 186cm (6'1"") and found the bath way to small, and one of the reasons we booked this hotel was the bath.  :-(
Check in staff were very friendly and were very keen to offer upgrades as my partner is a previous customer, the conversation got a bit confusing as he made several upgrade offers that we could pay for (it felt a bit clumsy and a bit used car sales at the desk), but then he upgraded us for free so that turned out really well.  Just noting here for the hotel that check-in should be a quick easy experience and not a sales opportunity, it just felt a bit clumsy and cheap.  All done with total friendliness and a smile and resulted in a nice upgrade and some happy guests.
Note that we found the COVID restrictions still being in place in Sydney and the hotel (masks in public areas) a bit jarring when coming from a jurisdiction were things have returned too close to normal (late November 2021).  Not suggesting that is the hotel's fault, more an observation about visiting Sydney.  I'm happy to do what the hotel and local authorities think best, but just a note for others that Sydney is still a bit jarring when it comes to COVID control (especially when vaccination levels are the best in the country after the smaller ACT).",en

We took a walk along the bay in the morning, walked to Westfield shopping centre. It is super close to public transport as well if that’s what you need.
The SERVICE is amazing! definitely 5 star worthy. They open the car doors and front doors for you every single time, all the staff are absolutely lovely! The rooms are super clean & comfy! The bed is the best bed i’ve ever slept on. Watch the sunrise in the morning from your grand window that faces the bed! There’s perfect room service, a turn down service they offer where they provide fresh towels and water later in the day. The pool and spa are really nice! I couldn’t fault this hotel at all!

Located right at Circular Quay on The Rocks side it couldn’t be easier to get around to see the sites of Sydney. We would have loved a water view but that came at a price point so City View it was. The room was better than any stayed in before - mainly due to the comfort of the bed and the pillows but also the superb blockout blinds. The room has a double set of blinds with the inner having side tracks to ensure light doesn’t disturb a wonderfully comfortable sleep and the outer being for privacy while also letting light through during the day time when preferred. The other great feature was that the in room lighting as well as the bathroom have a night button which has non-invasive subdued lighting for use during the night when you don’t want flooding light for partner disturbance. Being right on George St we were a little worried that road noise could be a problem but the double/triple glazing looked after that. We were on the 28th floor and traffic noise couldn’t be heard. Will definitely be staying again.",There was nothing that we didn’t like about this property.,en

Especially the location, which is next to the cirrcular quay, you may just take the metro around the cbd and shop everywhere....and the conciege is really nice that they ran over to help you when they seeing you hold a lot of things on hand....Four Season is finally the one my husband would wanna to stay again next time when we travel to sydney.","i made the booking online from booking.com, however, over the courtesy text i realised that the room i booked was only for 2 adults, but i had 2 kids with me, there were no indication when i made the booking online, so therefore, i had no choice to upgrade it to a premium room by paying $320 extra per night so i paid $640 extra for two nights (on top of what i had paid over booking.com), where the lady i spoke with before the trip told me that it's $220/night extra for the upgrades, which i am a little shocked about it but my husband said it's okay as we had a nice stay and you know, the room still worth it.
and on the other hand, the room is big and nice and overall very clean....only thing is that when we checked it, there were two hair clips one left on the floor, and one on the bed side table , which means the housekeeping didn't do a nice check when they did the cleaning......we just simply threw that away, but everything else seems all good and very clean.",en-us

We enjoyed the options in the breakfast package, all the delicious items you would expect in a buffet breakfast.
We loved it because having a served breakfast is more hygienic, comfortable and we noticed less food waste - with buffet breakfast, we always end up with uneaten food items on our plate and it is sometimes a nuisance having to walk around and put your own morning meal together. We also loved the friendly guys who met us at the car on arrival. Particularly Pasquale and Nasser - always smiling and warm. Wonderful personalities to greet and farewell us.","We didn't like the pool situation with covid 19.
I think that bookings system for the pool should be more streamlined and clear. We would have liked an online booking system with clear times of the pool sessions rather than having to walk down to the pool and register only to have the registration lost among staff. Having just come out of Sumner, we were surprised there had not been a more streamlined way to book ahead with the pool.",en

", 9.0 ,It’s got awesome views - clean - classy,I needed an extra room key as my wife was sleeping and I had forgotten my own one in the room. I noticed a huge check in line so I didn’t want to wait for 30 mins for a room key. So I approached One of the front desk members standing around the covid check in area - of Indian subcontinental ethnicity - don’t remember his name - I clearly expressed my intention not to want to wait in line for a simple access card. And I even handed over my license and room number which was in my name. He made me feel like I was a questionable character and that ‘I will have to check if we can help you or you will have to wait in line’ so I told him I don’t need his service. A few moments later I approach a lady who appeared to be a senior manager and I told her my circumstance and handed over my license and she immediately went to the front desk and handed me the key along with my license. This impression really upset me as I wouldn’t expect such rude and presumptuous behavior from a 5 star hotel. I’ve stayed in the best hotels in the world from Switzerland to Asia to The Middle East. Never felt like this in my life. Willl not go back if they have individuals like that.,en-us

Bed and pillows very comfortable.  You pay a little more for a HV but it is well worth it.  Room service food is very good quality.  The only improvement would be if they could move the Mode Restaurant upstairs and away from the foyer, it looks a bit out of place when you walk into reception.  Make the entrance a little more grander, some nice lounges and furnishings.  And please bring back the Lobby Bar which was tucked away at back of ground floor, it was very cosy, nice lounges and big wing chairs, quite grand looking and a piano man would be good.",As above please move the Mode Restaurant upstairs and bring back the Lobby Bar.  The pool could do with an update and perhaps some resurfacing of the tiles in pool and spa to freshen it up.   I would give both the pool and spa good scrub as well to brighten it.,en

1. I had purchased a Louis Vuitton bag and I asked reception whether it was safe to leave in our room while we go out for dinner that night.  (It may be a foolish,  since your hotel is five star,  however I still asked anyway).  
The lady at the reception was sort of laughing and saying ""Oh it is safe,  it is safe"". But I felt she said this in a mocking way.  She could have said in a professional manner,  ""Madam,  you don't have to worry,  your bag will be safe in your room, I guarantee. "" Or somewhere along those lines instead of saying it the way she said it,  which was unprofessional and informal, as if we were friends.  That annoyed me a little.  
2. When my husband and I had breakfast at Mode, I raised my hand to get the attention of a server because we were given our food but had no utensils and napkin to use. They had forgotten to give us, so I raised my hand and I saw the server see me but she pretended not to see and walked past me. I had to actually say ""Excuse me, can we please have our utensils so we can eat"", only then did she acknowledge me.  That was also annoying and spoiled the experience.",en

We left the room a huge mess after a scramble for clothes, and came back to everything above and beyond. We were embarrassed but so grateful! Even our clothes folded and neatly laid out. It felt like special touches.
The food was delicious. Beds were OMG!! View helped drain every stress away. 
Staff were the best I’ve encountered at any hotel ever.","Breakfast options weren’t fully explained at check  in, but after a bit of confusion with amazing staff, everything went super smoothly - until breakfast on the last day. 
My order was left off breakfast (it wasn’t available and I wasn’t notified) and the juice was so gingery I couldn’t drink it - but again, after contacting room service they rushed through my alternative order. So, not really anything to actually complain about to be honest :-)",en

", 9.0 ,"We stayed in a deluxe king room with harbour view and it definitely delivered. Classic Sydney view of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge - it's perfect (ignoring the eyesore that is the Cahill Expressway). And not just glimpses, it's the full panorama and at night, I could lie in the very comfortable bed and watch the cars driving across the bridge. For $300, I thought this was very good value considering how expensive Sydney can be.
Happily it didn't end there - this is one of the best locations in Sydney. The tram stops almost directly outside and takes you south to the shopping streets and further if you need. I also prefer this end of Sydney (I work down the other end and it's pretty boring), and Four Seasons is just on the edge of the Rocks - much nicer than walking out into corporate downtown Sydney and lots of interesting stuff nearby, including some good eateries. Go to the tourism info centre in the Rocks and they'll give you a map for a local walking tour you can do yourself. And of course there's the ferry to Manly nearby - it may be cliched but it's also very enjoyable. We took the express boat which was $9 compared to the somewhat slower public ferry at $7.
The hotel itself is very well appointed - nice foyer and helpful staff. While it might have been built some time ago, it's been kept up to date.
Our room was not large but had plenty of room (you'd get two large suitcases in easily without tripping over them). I really liked the window seat overlooking the view.There's a full length mirror (a very rare thing even in upmarket hotels) and hanging space for clothes plus an iron and board.
Bathroom was not too pokey, with a separate shower and bath and nicely lined in marble. Also had a lighted magnifying mirror for makeup and shaving.
Two large pillows each and crisp sheets.","When we checked out the next day, the staff were only too happy to put it in a fridge for me. An unusual request I thought but they weren't phased at all.
What didn't I like? Not much. Only thing really was that there was no information on how much the mini bar items were - too much no doubt and the prices may have been in the ipad thingy but I prefer a laminated list.
And that's about all.  
As a resident of Sydney, if I were recommending a hotel for a visitor, I would immediately suggest Four Seasons for comfort and location. It's a little pricey but especially if you're coming here from the other side of the world (well, hopefully you will be able to someday), it would be perfect.",en

The hotel were very obliging and said that was not a problem. They asked what the occasion was that we were staying and I explained the situation. On arrival, when we were checking in, the Manager of the hotel, Mitchell approached me and personally welcomed me to the hotel and said that if there was anything I needed to let him know. This was a lovely welcome. Then when we entered the room, the staff had a bottle of bubbles on ice for us and a card to say Get Well.

When we arrived we were told we had to book and it was sold out now and would have to park in a car park around the back and walk back to the hotel. They did offer to validate our ticket for $15 but I would of liked the hotel to message us when they started booking out of valet parking as they knew we wanted it just as a courtesy since they had told us no need to book.

", 10 ,"We chose to stay at Four Seasons for our essential trip in the midst of COVID-19 in the hopes that a fancier hotel would have superior levels of safety and cleanliness. These expectations were surpassed. Staff were extremely welcoming and helpful upon arrival despite the pandemic. All common areas and the room were impeccably clean (observed regular cleaning and noted twice daily housekeeping). Guests have their temperature taken on check-in and once daily to ensure safety. We enjoyed a lovely room service dinner in our room. The bed was very comfortable. Block out blinds in the room, quiet air conditioning, and sound proofing combined to ensure a great night’s sleep. We received an upgrade despite a great rate due to the state restrictions. Ordinarily we’d not be able to afford the hotel, however our very pleasant stay may make us reconsider in future- the higher rate may be worth the significantly extra comfort. Thank you.",None,en-us

Having stayed in the hotel a year ago (in December) we knew what to expect, but our view was even better, and the rooms were great after the renovations that have occurred. We had dinner on one occasion in the restaurant and the service wasn't quite as previously experienced. Perhaps because it was busy.","Appreciated the ability to book lounge access for one evening and breakfast, but felt that service was a little over the top, ie as soon as one put down ones cutlery, the plate was being taken away. Didn't like having to ask for wine each time. Have been used to hotel lounges allowing guests to help themselves to a glass. This put a little of a damper on our wonderful stay, and I think that the management of the lounge need to review their strategic directions, objectives, and customer service.",en

", 9.0 ,"I just checked out from an unbelievable stay at the four Seasons hotel in Sydney Australia.  The hotel accommodations were nice. My only complaint was there are no accessible outlets in the room.  A gentleman from maintenance needed to come to our room to add an extension cord in order for us to charge our electronic devices.  This minor inconvenience however was quickly forgotten when we was greeted by the staff of Lounge 32.  My travel companion and I always pay the additional amount to have club access whenever we travel.  The Four Season staff however has truly gone above and beyond to ensure our stay was stress free.  We were always greeted with a smile and quickly ushered to our table to enjoy the view with drinks and appetizers.  This treatment is to be expected from club level staff.  But what has stood out in my mind is the great length Charlotte and David went to in order that I had a stress free flight the day before my departure.  I realized the day before my flight that I needed additional baggage allowance for an early morning flight.  After being unable to add the additional baggage online Charlotte took the time to call Qantas Airlines and waited hours for a call back to pay for the additional luggage I needed.  She kept me in the loop until I left for an excursion, and at that time contacted me via email requesting the go ahead from me to purchase the additional baggage.  I did not see the email until I returned to the hotel later that evening, and David had to call back to complete the transaction.  David also tirelessly remained on hold for 4 hours to purchase the additional baggage for me.  This act of kindness and attention truly stood out with me.  It allowed me to enjoy my last day in Sydney and to have a smooth check-in this morning at the airport.  All the staff at Club 32 are phenomenal.  Dion, and Amy were also great in setting up reservations for certain restaurants.",There were no accessible outlets in the room to charge our phone and electronics.  This problem was rectified by supplying us with extension cords for us to use.,en-us

Our Partial Harbor room had a view of the opera house if you looked hard enough and the full-harbor room was able to capture both the bridge and opera house during vivid...but you don't get a full-scale panoramic view of it, so your money is probably better spent on the Partial Harbor view. The overall vibe of the hotel is very 5-star 1990s. I'm sure it was a great hotel a few decades ago, but it doesn't seem to have aged well. Walls are also very thin as the sound carries in the halls.",en

- l went downstairs to get a cab out to dinner. The bellboy did not approach us (there was no one else there)  so l approached him and asked him to arrange a cab. He walked to the street and said there are none. He then told us our best approach would be to hail a cab ourselves in the street

The bell boys that helped us with our bags were so courteous and helpful. One tends to remember these things fondly.

When concerns were raised, staff listened and were attentive to attend to the concerns promptly and with excellence. 
The beds, mattress and pillows were exquisite. We can’t remember having had such amazing sleep at a hotel for sometime now. 
All in all, we had an enjoyable week long stay.","The door separating the bedroom and the living room in our suite was faulty leading to an unfortunate morning of trying to pry the door open with our daughters stuck inside. 
Engineering dealt with the matter when raised and all was well. That it would happen in the first place was unbecoming of the four seasons and their repute for safety and quality. 
The lounge was not functional throughout the week and when opened for access on the weekend was littered with petty rules that bode the sense of being calculative, ungenerous and stingy. Not at all what you’d expect from the Four Seasons. 
The hotel decor seemed dated and aged. While some element of yesteryear charm would prove to enrich the ambience, this served more as a stark reminder of how much the hotel fell short of our expectation of the Four Seasons. 
We required 2 baby cots in the room as we were traveling with our toddlers aged 1 and 3. The cots provided were creaky, rusty and dated. My 3 year older spent the week sleeping in the fetal position as she wasn’t able to stretch out due to size constraints. Most disappointing.",en

The manager greeted everyone else that was checking in apart from us even after making eye contact with me a few times and we waited in line for 10 minutes and still nothing as he was directing new people to check in desks, nothing to us. 
Our room didn't have a remote for the TV, the room service we got for dinner was average despite the price, special instructions were ignored without any notice (we asked for no eggs with our breakfast both mornings as my partner is allergic and they were still sent) and one of our bags with personal belongings was mistaken for rubbish and thrown out. There was a few hundred dollars worth of stuff in that bag and we got compensated $50 towards dinner.

Also, while I understand the use of masks is recommended by the Four Seassons, I think due to current NSW recommendations guests should not have to wear them. There’s plenty of room to socially distance and if we aren’t wearing them on public transport and can attend nightclubs... it is excessive. The receptionist at check in was passive aggressive when I expressed my concerns to her, which wasn’t well received.

Delay was because “100% occupancy” but OK you’re a premium hotel - checking in by 3.00 should be achievable.
Should be separate casual and fine dining restaurant offering. Restaurant food was OK but compromised by lobby location - should be back upstairs in original restaurant location on level 3 and current lobby location set up as more casual option. Guests were either dressed up for special occasions or in T-shirt’s and shorts. 
Also Bar only open between 4.00 to 11.00. Maybe reduced hours due to COVID, but a little early to close in an international hotel.
Having stayed at Four Seasons in Paris and Bali, this hotel doesn’t have the wow factor like other Four Seasons - maybe Covid impact on opening hours/staff levels so hopefully some of these comments will improve once everything back to normal.",en

When i did use the chat function in the app, they said they will bring in a technician to fix the Chromecast for Netflix and we waited half an hour before I messaged them again about it and then someone finally came but Netflix was not resolved. The next morning I messaged the chat via the app to order breakfast and was told to use the tablet in the room which was flat already .. it was not sitting on the charger correctly , I told the chat this and so they said they will call us to take the order.  We ended up charging the tablet and ordering it via the tablet . We ended up getting a call 30 minutes later to get breakfast order. I think overall if we didn't followup you would not rely on the service desk go assist you. End of the stay we didn't have Netflix working properly which .. definitely affected our stay.

As it was a beautiful sunny weekend this was the main reason we choose to stay at the four seasons as it had a outdoor pool so when we couldn't even use the pool or sit outside somewhere at the hotel to enjoy the lovely weather it really put a dampener on our special night away. The only chance to use the pool was at 8am the next morning before we checked out. We ended up having to leave the hotel and find a bar nearby that we could sit outside and enjoy a drink.

I’d taken a sip before I realised and was quite surprised - when I told the front desk they didn’t say much other than “oh, we won’t charge you for that one.” I know people do some strange things in hotel rooms but I probably expected a stronger reaction from the hotel staff considering how serious something like that could be. Otherwise we really enjoyed it and that just ended my stay on kind of a strange note.",en

", 7.0 ,The room was obviously very nice due to the great view. Bed was comfy. Good pillows.,"I had prepared a cake to be presented in the room for my girlfriend and had been in contact with the hotel over the phone, through the booking app originally, and via email. I'd talked about how I wanted to make the cake a special surprise for my girlfriend and had ordered it externally. The staff agreed to help me put the cake in the room for my girlfriend and to co-ordinate the timing as to surprise her when we got back from our dinner. I had said how I wanted it to be special etc on the phone. Even at the counter when I checked in and my girlfriend stayed at the chairs I explained it. Anyway, I take her in and it's literally just the delivery box the cake came in with a big A4 receipt stapled on top and a fragile handling sticker. Basically the shipping box. There were no plates or cutlery to eat it with either. After being disappointed that my girlfriend was meant to see a beautiful cake after walking in after dinner and instead saw a plain white box with a receipt on top, I voiced my disapproval on how it was done using the in room messaging app, and was ignored and never got a message back for the following 16ish hours of our stay. I found this very disappointing. 
Furthermore, breakfast is listed in the app not including GST which is weird, so after we ordered according to the total spend limit we were told we had with 'breakfast included', we saw that the total cost would actually be even higher. There was also a larvae in one of the napkins but it wasn't a big deal. The napkins in general didn't seem overly clean, although everything else in the room did and was otherwise well kept.",en

", 7.0 ,"It is very difficult for a five star brand like the Four Seasons to 'pivot' during the catastrophe that is the global pandemic. Kudos to this property, for offering their rooms at bargain basement prices in order to survive. The result was a weekend getaway for us that was a real treat. Our deluxe city room had an amazing view right up George Street - normally the hub of the city but now eerily devoid of life. The bed was quite possibly the most comfortable pillow topped cloud of bliss Ive ever slept in and the room very stylish and homely at once. The hotel has implemented a comprehensive Covid Safe plan, which involved mask wearing for all guests and passing through a temperature check on entering the building. Whilst this hardly creates the usual atmosphere one seeks in a sophisticated venue, it did provide some reassurance that the hotel was taking the pandemic seriously. Five star hotels are assessed not just on facilities but on the standard of service - and on this count, the Four Seasons can be proud. All staff were attentive, caring, prompt and articulate in all interactions. Given the difficulties of offering a five star experience during these Covid times, they did a commendable job. The hotel is in the best possible location in Sydney - making it possible to catch a tram, or train or to walk to every main sight and shop in town.","Unfortunately, the bargain basement room prices also attract a clientele that is not the usual preserve of this hotel. I was woken in the middle of the night by a spontaneous party in the room next door, where guests appeared to be using their room as a quasi nightclub. On contacting reception, security handled the matter promptly but it resulted in a completely sleepless night for me. The staff seemed truly alarmed this had happened and I received an apology on checkout. This situation was not the fault of the hotel and they handled it admirably - but room rates that low may not be ideal if the hotel is wishing to retain its reputation as a reliable haven of peace and comfort.",en-us

We ordered breakfast, they rang to say we would have to wait 1 hour to get it to our room, but go to the restaurant it will be a lot quicker. We went down stairs and it was absolutely packed and we would have to wait one hour there too.
We had booked a spa treatment, I asked for two people in the same room 11am two back massages for 60 minutes. To my absolute disappointment I wasn’t able to get my massage as a therapist wasn’t available. I had to sit and wait for my partner to get his massage, which he only got for 45 minutes not 60 as we had asked for. I was so annoyed and let down. The changing room was also not open so therefore we didn’t get to go to the pool.
We were so disappointed as I had heard great things about the hotel and really looked forward to our city break for a romantic night.

I wanted to ask about how to access the premium Wi-Fi which I believe was included in my package but it was not obvious from the website interface whether I was in fact about to subscribe a second time and I couldn't be sure that it would not be a long process to remedy this if I was double charged. I just wanted to make a simple call to clarify this basic process but couldn't get a hold of someone and as my number of attempts increased my frustration grew. I also asked if there was anything special they could do for my wife's birthday but there was no response and nothing in the room when we arrived. I also wasn't able to clarify how to access the inclusions for my room. The heated pool was very cold. The coffee was poor, I ordered a large and got a small/regular size, they forgot my juice and the porridge was very sweet. The in room dining was not that convenient either we had to lean forward to eat everything off the coffee table or I had to take some makeshift placemats over to the study table or move the arm chairs either side of the dolly, this could only really be done by moving the coffee table behind the door so it was really just a lot of work. Also some of the fittings need replacement or attention, the paint of the bathroom door was peeling, rusty nail in the shower frame.",en

This did not happen and we eventually were given access to a room at about 4pm. 
The Reservations team had attached a completely unknown and separate person to my booking which caused additional problems. 
Lastly. the pool area was a disaster zone with too few sunloungers and only person on duty. 
These may seem petty issues but when booking an FS property you do expect better and I do have to acknowledge that this is the first time I have ever had an issue at any FS property and have stayed at a number.

I understood with Covid restrictions that breakfast would be limited.
However, I had to ask 3 or 4 times for the hot milk I requested with my coffee, by the time it arrived the coffee was cold and the rest of the food had arrived.
I ordered the fruit platter and would have preferred to eat the fruit, or at least some of it prior to the hot meal arriving.
I ordered one poached egg with bacon, tomato and rye toast. The egg was perfect, toast good, however the bacon was deep fried, or seemed to be so and sitting in a pool of oil on the plate. I didn’t eat it, similarly the tomatoes weren’t hot and seemed to have been cooked some time before, which is fine, but not really reheated in an appetising way.

I was not accepted initially to Four Seasons Hotel because my booking.com account had a different name than it is in my passport. I am a frequent traveller and something like this never happened before with other hotels, like Shangri La or Hilton, just to mention a few, I had never problem with different name on booking.com.
Mitchell was quite arrogant, insisting I had to change my name on Booking.com profile and he told me to call Booking.com immediately and to ask them to change my booking name so it is matching my passport name. I was not happy about this strange request, so I said I want to see where is it written that booking.com name should be the same as my passport name and he could not provide me with this information, just repeating it was Four Seasons Hotel policy and he could not accept my reservation.
I told him I want to speak with Hotel Manager immediately. Initially he claimed to be a Manager himself, but obviously he was not, as then suddenly he just left angry with my credit card and was away for some time.
As I was just released from the Hospital after an open surgery and wanted to have some relaxing recovery, it was not a good start at all of my stay, considering I was checking in at the 5 star Hotel.
I was very stressed and humiliated. Mitchell was not even considering to help me or to offer me a seat during our long conversation, even if I explained him I was not feeling well and was just back from the hospital after major surgery. After I was in pain standing there for a long time, listening to Mitchell, I was very tired and had to sit down.
After about another 10 min, Hotel manager came to me with apologies about misunderstanding and gave me an upgrade to a room. Mitchell however appeared without apologies later with the key and a document  to sign for checking in. He gave me back my credit card and left again.",en

The man that checked us in advised they were not prepared at all to accommodate the amount of people who they had booked in.
Went to the lobby twice to get the breakfast included in our stay at the 1 restaurant that was open however the lines were all the way through the hotel and were not moving, we ended up going to a cafe outside due to the amount of people waiting in the lobby (also terribly socially distanced and blocking almost every walkway).
After going outside for some fresh air, I asked the man at the temperature check if I could have one of the masks he had (because I had mixed mine up with my partners in my pocket outside) and instead of giving me a mask, he started to pretty much yell at me, and told me I was not allowed to go through the lobby (mind you there was numerous people in the lobby not wearing masks however I didn’t feel comfortable walking in without one on). He eventually gave me a mask and as I was standing there getting it out of the packet, he started to get angry that I hadn’t got it out of the packet yet. When I started to walk away, he demanded I go back and give him my room number and wrote it down and shook his head at me and told me to go.
I was so shocked and uncomfortable after it that I just wanted to leave so I got my things and went straight to checkout - which there were yet again large queues for.
Overall terribly organised and rude staff. Is definitely not worth what you are paying and I will not be staying at a four seasons hotel again.",en

Saltwater restaurant does a fantastic three course meal which is great value.,"This is not the standard I expected from a Hyatt. Rooms are very small. There is nothing luxurious about this hotel and the cheap items in the bathroom - a single soap and tiny body cream were poor. This was made worse by the shampoo, conditioner and body wash being set into the shower and obviously refilled once fully used it. This felt unhygienic and unpleasant. Usually Hyatt’s have some sense of luxury with the bedroom and bathroom. If you want this, go somewhere else. You’re really paying for the location. There is also no on site parking. We had to park at Wilson’s across the road and there limited parking spaces. The ground floor bar was closed off for a wedding so couldn’t be accessed at all.

There are stairs at the back of the hotel to access darling harbour. I think they should inform you at check-in or have it written somewhere. I asked for the quickest route which is how I found out. We had to lift the pram up quite a lot of steps to access it though. Using the front entrance it’s a short walk to darling harbour though the public escalators were broken which is why I was looking for a different route.
We had a drink in the bar downstairs which was lovely. The food in the bar/restaurant looked good but we ordered room service so our baby could sleep. The food was ok. Overall I would recommend this hotel and I would stay again.",None,en

By comparison the Swissotel a few blocks away and of similar cost/standard provides a free water bottle per guest per day. It seems a small thing but it's also a small thing to give guests a bottle of water. There is a free filtered water machine at each lift but the lift was a long way from our room, in another building, so it was too far to go for cold water.
The rooms at the Swissotel have a coffee pod machine while Hyatt only uses instant coffee.

", 7.5 ,"I had chosen the hotel primarily for the closeness for the Overseas Passenger Terminal for my cruise, and it suited that purpose well.
Check in and check out were super fast.
Internet was reliable and fast.
Staff were friendly and approachable.
Beds were comfortable.  Room was large for the two of us.  Bathroom was a decent size.","I accept the necessity that the hotel may need to put a bank hold on the first night's stay, in order to be compensated for clients not showing.  That is fine.  I was FURIOUS that the Hyatt Regency put a hold on the two nights I had booked, AND the laundry service that my sister and I had done as well.  I have used laundry services at many hotels, in many countries.  NEVER, have I had that amount ordered to be held by my bank, by the hotel.
What this meant was that when I checked out, I noticed the pending amount for night one in my bank details, and queried the total bill I was being asked to pay.  It was explained that the hold would be released by my bank once payment was processed.  I understood this, so I paid the total $700 (approx.), which included 2 nights and laundry services.
When I next checked my bank account, while on a cruise ship, I discovered that the entire amount had been deducted (as of check out time), and the entire $700 was also now being held as pending in my account.  So this meant essentially $1400 was deducted for the services I received.  Not having access to call the hotel on the ship, I contacted Booking.com.  I was told the hold would be ""released"" within 7-10 days.  That is WAY too much time to be on holidays without that much money, particularly when I hadn't budgeted on that . It took 11 days for all of the money to be back in my account to use.
I have used Booking before; I have travelled immensely.  I have NEVER experienced this before.  This alone would be my reason for not returning to this hotel, and sharing my experience with family, friends and other travellers.",en

", 8.3 ,"I really liked how comfortable the rooms were and how clean the bathrooms were inside the rooms. The location is also great - giving us a great view from our room, and from the Zephyr Bar of the Darling Harbour. The staff checking us in (a young man) was excellent providing us a very warm welcome to the hotel.","There were a number of things that I personally thought were not reflective of the star rating given to this hotel. Although the food provided at breakfast was great, a variety of issues did arise that I did not like. Firstly, I became aware that the hotel had held a wedding the night before. Whilst this is totally acceptable and the hotel attempted to manage the wedding by providing them with a separate room for the guests for breakfast, I felt as though the hotel could have gone further by providing extra food stations (e.g. having set up a continental/full breakfast stations inside the given room) so to avoid the lengthy lines that arose from them coming into the breakfast room (and almost ruining the relaxing & romantic atmosphere that the hotel with this star rating should have). Additionally, I did not like how the butter was placed (i.e. in a huge clump on a plate). I feel as though it is not of standard at all - especially considering guests have no idea if any children/other guests have just accidentally touched the butter, or how long it's been out for or if any insects (i.e. flies) have landed on the butter without anyone seeing. It is my advice to provide guests with butter in a packet in the same way the hotel did for the jam, peanut butter, or honey for example for hygiene reasons.
Also, the staff member checking us out had, unlike the gentleman checking my partner and I in, poor communication skills. I felt as though she gave me no sign in the conversation to suggest that I was all clear to go after she had taken payment and was left standing there for an extra 5 minutes thinking that her typing in the next computer meant that something had gone wrong. I personally had to interfere and ask if everything was good to go for her to even glance at me and say yes, I was in the clear. This is not something I'd expect and staff should be trained with numerous signals to end a conversation e.g.",en

", 7.5 ,"The check in was wonderful and the young male staff member who helped me was appropriatelt helpful and attentive. He took pride in his work. In fact all of the male staff I encountered were polite and well trained. This is what makes Hyatt well known.
Room service staff of both genders were sooo polite. Exactly the kind of pleasant greetings that make you feel happier as a single traveler.
The layout of my room was wonderful. Nice un imposing Hyatt colour palate, high quality furniture and fixtures. Not too grotesquely modern and masculine like the sheraton on the park redesign which made me choose the hyatt regency for this trip.
The foyer was modern and appealing to the eye.
The Hyatt pillows never disappoint!! Bliss.","Some of the female wait staff in the dining room at breakfast seemed disinterested and did not want to be there. Was too afraid to call for assistance for coffee so had to wait for an older male staff to see my body language and come over.
The grilled tomato had cheese on it. I am vegan and also lactose intolerant so it was disappointing to have my go to hot food breakfast option unavailable if paying for buffet. But the buffet was wonderful for the hotel being a down grade from other Hyatt I have stayed at. If you are a fruit brekkie eater you are all set.
The carpet in the old wing was disgusting. I was soooo relieved when I got to my wing and saw clean carpet. Maybe this is again my lack of experience staying in this class of hotel? ðŸ˜• It was confronting though. If my wing had been carpeted like this I may have just left for another hotel.

", 1.0 ,"nice location convenient to city and Harbour, good view of the Harbour and out into western Sydney.","Not happy at all with the stay and hospitality offered by Hyatt Regency, I am not one to knit pick but for a supposed 5 star hotel and the price of almost $500 a night for a small standard room it didnâ€™t add value in comparison to some of the other 5 star hotels in Sydney city I have stayed in (shangrila, the darling, sofitel) 
our room when we arrived had quite dusty and dirty carpet with crumbs and spicks over it which you would think be spotless upon arrival. I called the front desk in the morning notifying them and asking if it could get a thorough vacuum whilst my partner and I went out for the day and after being apologized to was reassured it would be cleaned right away and spotless by the time we got back. we left around 11am and got back at 2-3pm and returned and it had still not been cleaned so I called reception again and notified them and was told someone would be sent right away. half an hour later someone finally came.
My partner is 38 weeks pregnant and we had to leave the room while they finally cleaned it which couldâ€™ve been done when we where already out like we where told would happen. I notified before arriving my partner was heavily pregnant so you think a clean room would be paramount. after we came back from it being serviced nothing else was done, no beds where made ( even though we did not leave a massive mess it wouldâ€™ve been nice to have cleaned) and no fresh toiletries or towels.
we where also put in a room on the top floor which was 2 rooms away from Zephyr Bar the music blasted all of Friday and Saturday night and you could hear it in our room which did not make or add to a relaxing stay. 
there is also no complimentary water in room and for a 5 star hotel you think a few bottles would be bare minimum but I suppose not here. 
seems to be a real lack of care and urgency will be writing a formal complaint to them",en

I flew with my team on a corporate booking and reserved 3 rooms. One of my colleagues left their room around midnight and upon returning 10 minutes later they couldn't access their room. They gained access about 1 and a half hours later and were inconvenienced from around midnight to 145am. The management didn't seem to care at all my team could not get a good night's sleep the night before they had to work all day. They had flown in that morning too and worked all day so we're exhausted. When we discussed this with the management team on duty they were aggressive, abrupt, and really rude, not caring or understanding at all that a room we paid for they couldn't let us in. If I had been traveling with my family and had a child in my room I would be extremely concerned they could not open a door for over an hour and a half?! My colleague needed to access medication and when this was explained we were questioned abruptly on what medication (again none of the managers on duty business!) They offered two free breakfasts as compensation and a late check out (again not listening to our complaint of how we were working all weekend so a late check out was not a solution along with two free breakfasts when we were a team of 5! They then offered half-price breakfasts for the remaining 3 of us, we refused all breakfasts as I did not want to give any more money to a hotel that is totally incompetent and does not care about its clients.

stood in line for 15/20 minutes while everyone else was checked in. 
i was not greeted or even acknowledged by the staff for those 20 minutes the duty manager and fo staff kept checking other people in that came in after. on complaining they said they have upgraded to a room with a view. 
the walls are paper thin. could hear toilet flush and kids crying the whole night. 
my stay was in prepaid and the staff charged the credit card and upon complaining they said the money will come back right away. since then we have been calling and there’s no response. we still don’t have the money back and the manager emailed saying he will give us an upgrade next time we stay (which will never happen). 
this is anything but a 5- star experience. absolutely shocked and disappointed with the whole experience. will not recommend this hotel to anyone.",en

Then the room wasn't ready so we waited another 45 mins. Once in our room, we were waiting around half an hour for our bags to be bought up by the concierge. In the end, we ended up going back down to the lobby and collecting them ourselves. Only one cup in a double room to have a cup of tea - had to call housekeeping for an extra cup to be bought up. Finally, upon request, we were granted a late check out at 1pm on our final day and after coming back from our morning walk to collect our cases just after midday, we had been locked out of our room so had to get a staff member to open our room. Basically, in my opinion, an overhaul of customer service (certainly more staff at reception) is required to be considered. 
Bed comfortable but pillows were not - much too soft :-( Not enough storage space to put clothes and none at all in the bathroom for toiletries.",en

The bathroom also flooded when we showered and the air conditioning was temperamental. For $370 a night, we definitely did not get our money's worth.

I also paid for 2 adults and 1 child's breakfast but kept getting asked to pay extra for my sons breakfast. Thankfully they didn't charge me in the end. 
The shower was slippery and my son slipped while entering the shower. The lounge in the room was covered in pieces of broken plastic, the room didn't look like it was vacuumed before we arrived. The bathroom wasn't very clean, looked like some dry snot on the shower walls. 
There was also half a bottle of moisturiser left in the bathroom. They also tried to charge for a chocolate bar we bought from the convenience store across the road. The worst part was we left the wrapper in the bottom of the bin so I'm assuming someone went through our rubbish rather than checking that it belonged to the mini bar.",en

Requested a harbour view as it was my anniversary but were so inflexible that they wouldn't change it, even though i offered to pay extra. Buffet breakfast was ok.

On checking out, we had breakfast and then asked reception if we could have a trolley for our bags as we had a lot of stuff due to being on our honeymoon and hotel hopping for 12 nights. 
They said they would be up straight away half an hour had passed so we just lugged it all down instead as we had to go.

", 1.0 ,Not Much,"On arrival at your hotel at 4.30 pm, I was disappointed that from the start, despite the fact I had booked a Suite there was no check-in clerk for Suite only or express checking in as I experience in other hotels,
After 35 minutes of waiting to get to check-in I was informed that the twins were not adjoining but the Suite was to next one, I asked if I could at least get the twins together to which I was told NO.
At this point, I was asked for the payment for the rooms and a deposit totalling  $1500.00 which I informed the clerk I would pay from my personal account as this was not a business trip,
The clerk that checked me in just handed me the room keys and that was it, NO Information about the hotel not as much as where the elevators were,
On arriving at the elevators we had to queue for the elevators despite the fact one elevator was for the BAR GUSTS ONLY  it took a further  15 minutes to get to our rooms on Level 12 ( same as the BAR) totalling 1 hour to check-in and get to our rooms, only to find none of the room was ever close to adjoining,  1202, 1210, 1216, and that one of the rooms was a double, not twins as asked
At this point we had no time to do anything we had dinner reservations for 6.30 pm, after dinner, we decide  that the room arrangement was not safe for our younger children as there was no security pass required to get to level 12 and the room were too far apart so we had to send them home with our friends leaving one room useless,
On arriving back from dinner an 11.00 pm my wife, daughter,  her boyfriend, and myself attempted to enter the bar on level 12 to celebrate my daughter first legal drink, ( this was one of the main reasons to book your hotel )to be only told then that we need reservations, we inquired that even as guests were reservation required and the answer was yes,  we proceed to the ground level to find that the ground bar was holding a private function, then we see the queue for the Sky bar at least 45 minutes,",en

Also on checkout I had cash to pay for the stay so I didn't have to pay a card fee for no reason but they didn't even ask me they just put payment through my card and charged me a fee for a decision they made without my permission seems they are ripping people off to make back the money they lost during covid. beds are also way too soft. but rooms are nice.,en

Please be aware you will have to pay hundreds in parking because they have no parking at the hotel. Very over priced for what they are. Rooms not that great. I would not recommend staying here. There are plenty of nicer places to stay at in Sydney than here. Save your money and go else where. Also have to wait 20 minutes to check in and out of the hotel. Absolutely ridiculous.

They also said they would bring up a bottle of wine because it was such a special moment, which they failed to do. 
Parking.. don’t even get me started. It would’ve been cheaper to pay at the actual Wilson carpark than pay for the 2 day pass at the hotel! Could’ve saved myself $30+ by not paying for the 2 day pass.

The room was dirty with hair on the carpets. The furniture was pretty beaten up with chunks taken out of the timber, the chairs were threadbare and worn. The aircon was rattling all night and it was hard to sleep, the TV remote had old batteries and wasn’t working and the powerpoint beside the bed wasn’t working so had to charge my phone on the other side of the room.  There was no toothbrush or toothpaste, room service stops at 10.30pm and there’s a delivery fee of $8 which is in tiny fine print on the menu and if you want to watch a movie it’ll cost you $35. The staff were great, but check in took over 20 minutes. All in all, not what you expect for a 5 star hotel.

Very attentive customer service when we raised some issues of concern about our stay.,Breakfast was extremely busy and we had a very long wait for an ordinary breakfast with very undercooked eggs. They offered to re cook but we gave up. Lolli bag wrapper left under bed from previous occupant and lack of cleaning of shower screen. Bit of a worry during covid. Even though it is a non smoking hotel there were people smoking on other balconies and they left their beer bottle full of butts on the 6th floor lift lobby.

The second night our power went again, about 8pm the handyman came to fix the door and power. We were not at all keen to move rooms so we put up with it. This new room had no towels, Robes etc in it so we needed to sort that out. Shower time in the new room found us with no water pressure compared to the shower in the first room which was amazing.

", 1.0 ,The location and breakfast were good. The front of house and common areas and restaurants were nice. However it’s a nice facade for a gross hotel with less than satisfactory service and staff.,"Firstly, the hotel “mistakenly” double charged me, and held double the amount of funds at my bank. The front of office staff apparently couldn’t see this charge and made it extremely difficult to have their mistake rectified. The incompetent of manager Hayley led me to have to call back numerous times to follow up what was happening. Hayley pretended to send a fax through to my bank upon checkout and when I arrived home the bank advised a fax had not been sent. For this mistake I was then advised I would need to wait 5 days for the incorrect amount of funds to be released back to me (double the amount that should have been charged). On top of this, the hotel room was vastly different to what it shown in the pictures. Apparently there is a new and old building and the hotel is charging the same amount for the same room in the different buildings. We got a room in the old building that was old and unclean. There were cracked walls and an old musty bathroom. We even arrived back to the hotel with a cockroach on the floor in our bathroom. And cockroaches were on the floor of the hallways outside our room because of all the plates / bowls left outside guests doors for too long. Our windows were unclean so our Harbour view was tainted. The rooms were small and dark with old furnishings. The robes were like cardboard and so tough I may aswell have bought my own one. I had a miserable stay celebrating my birthday. Not only was I not able to access my money that the hotel should never have held in my account (all weekend mind you) but the hotel wasn’t even nice to be in. Then when trying to rectify issues, the staff are arrogant, explaining they “do this all the time” after double charging me. The staff don’t know how to deal with problems so they just lie to guests so they leave the hotel without fixing the issues. The staff are embarrassing for the company.",en

", 4.0 ,None,"First of all... for a 5 star hotel I thought the lack of understanding when I called room service was poor. I asked for a bottle of champagne to be brought up to the room. It took half an hour and only brought up the other 4 drinks I asked for, then waited another 20 mins for the champagne.
We were told that we didnt need to make a reservation for the rooftop bar, just to come down and someone would walk you up. We had our name put on the list and were going to be called when our reservation was ready, never received a call.
We stayed for a total of three nights and the whole experience was very underwhelming. 
Breakfast was very average, I understand that with covid there is no buffet service, thats fine but the very basic menu options were disappointing for a 5 star hotel - just basic eggs, bacon, sausages, hash browns and toast with a basic plate of fruit.",en-us

We tried to ask about the Wilsons and they refused to help us other than say “we have no affiliation and here is the website” ... the website didn’t have information for Sunday night and as it was Sunday night - we couldn’t call Wilsons and find out the pricing. The hotel wasn’t interested in helping us, just saying “we have no affiliation.” I get that you don’t have parking and are not affiliated with Wilsons parking but have some interest in helping your guests. You are a 5 star hotel! The hotel also ended up parking our car in Wilsons (which they said they had no affiliation with)! And charged us $90 for it. A total money making scheme and a rip off. We stayed at a much cheaper hotel around the corner the previous week who gave us overnight parking in Wilsons for $30.  It seems outrageous a hotel like this can’t offer something similar. 
When we arrived at the hotel (and amidst the Coronavirus pandemic) I asked if they were doing deep cleaning of the rooms and they said yes. So I felt reassured and I noticed hand sanitizer around the hotel. However, the truth came out at breakfast. We turned up and the breakfast room is huge! Yet they were seating everyone at tables close to each other in one corner - so close to each other!!! (not the 1.5m the government recommends) ... not to mention, the guy wiping down the tables was using an rag with NO SPRAY disinfectant!!! He literally wiped one table then moved to the other with the same cloth and then just placed cutlery on these surfaces. I am not paranoid that my room was cleaned in such a manner. 
 
We need to return to Sydney again tomorrow and have booked a different 5 star hotel that provides free parking for their guests and can prove to us that they are following proper protocol for the Coronavirus, not just putting hand sanitizers around the hotel to make it “look like” they are.",en-us

As it was Australia Day, we requested a Harbour View (Darling Harbour) but were told that if we had booked with the hotel direct, they would have been able to be more flexible and give us the room we requested. In addition, they were adamant that their price was what we would be paying and I had three different staff members to 'argue' with over $20. I had my confirmation in my hand but is became quite stressful after 30 minutes of arguing. The hotel is run down, the room was far less than average and definitely not acceptable. Food service in the bar area was dismal, 45 minutes for wedges to arrive. We are Hyatt members but were obviously treated like backstreet out-of-towners so they could fit in direct booking customers - with views- rather than customers from Booking.com (as stated by a male customer service member).

Room location was so far from the lifts.
For 3 nights stay we were out in a room with no view .
I was requesting if we could change to room with bath tub and I told that the hotel rooms do not have bath tubs! Quite surprising for a 4 star hotel.
When the room was made not everything was replaced and had to call housekeeping for missing items eg, cups, face towels 
Staff friendliness were inconsistent - chamber maids were not friendly, when I approached one to assist me with the ice machine  as there were no ice coming out he didnâ€™t offer to help was just told that â€˜ there are instructions on how to doâ€™ and when housekeeping brought the missing cup, the lady was looking at her phone while she handed me the cup - not professional.
We were given a champagne and seafood  buffet lunch gift to use at the Sailmaker - which we used and with such a big restaurant we were squashed next to the service table - was hard to have a conversation with my partner with staff constantly near the service table.
We wanted to celebrate our last night and ordered bottle of via room service, after 40 mins I had to chase it up and when it came they delivered tea bags, then they sent 2 glasses of wine on the fourth time they came they delivered the bottle of wine and had comp us for the lack of service but, by this stage we were frustrated and had killed our celebratory mood.",en

What we have here is clear corporate greed. Hyatt oversold their expensive New Year packages and didn't respond to the demand that came along. The Executive Lounge was appalling - not enough seats and lots of very loud children allowed to run around, manhandle the food and return it to the display, and generally make a nuisance of themselves.

They gave us complimentary valet parking - see why in my negative comments below.","4 things really stood out as a dislike for me.
1) On arrival the concierge on duty didn't acknowledge us in our car. So as we got out, and I started to unload our bags one of them walked up next to me and blew a taxi whistle in my ear. (Instant headache). He then asked if we were staying at the hotel - after giving my VW Polo a short glance. So I'm standing there unloading my bags and I'm asked if I'm staying at the hotel.
2) Then the receptionist at check-in showed my wife the card machine showing the hotel price - no discretion at all.
3) On departure I tried to had my car ticket to the concierge to collect our car so it was ready for after we return from breakfast  (as I was keen to do our return 4hr drive home asap) and was told to come back later after breakfast. So after our breakfast - where the 2nd coffee we ordered never arrived - I went to the concierge and we waited 15-20mins for our vehicle to be brought down. (Awesome, so we were late)
4) FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN  - Even though a) I reminded the restaurant manager/supervisor when we were waiting to be seated no less than 3 times that breakfast was included in our room.... and b) they could see on our booking that breakfast was included before they attempted to charge us.... THEY STILL CHARGED MY CARD for breakfast that was already included.
I had to call up and found out only AFTER i checked my credit card statement on the Monday after the Saturday stay. I was promised a call back from the manager, but after 3hrs waiting - I decided to put this review up on Booking.com.

When arriving told to find our own seats as it was table service.. waited 20 minutes for someone to take out order even though it wasn’t that busy, served drinks with no straw then to be told half way through our drinks that the waitress didn’t light our garnish.. waitress arrived couldn’t do it so did it myself (she was lovely though) wanted to order another drink but told by another waitress she couldn’t serve us cause she wasn’t in our section and would get into trouble but would send someone. No one came so decided to ask for bill instead when someone came over eventually asking if we ordered drinks (clearly another table) waited 45 minutes no bill arrived.. decided to take ourselves to the bar and do it on our own.. finally reached the Bar man after waiting on other customers passed us in to another waitress who didn’t look to happy that we walked up to pay our bill even though she originally set up the tab, cause we interrupted her giving google eyes to neck tattooed gentlemen.. all up would say this was the Only thing that ruined our stay.. I’m young and most of these guys were my age but I stayed here thinking it would be a cafe lounge type feel but instead left thinking I was stuck at a dirty nightclub.. sorry Zephyr but being in the same industry for 16 years and running pubs and nightclubs I know when something is not good for the overall brand and that is you..",en

The state of the hotel lies with the owners. They refuse to update the rooms and expect their clientele to be paying nearly $400/night during week nights in the off season. Always more than happy to pay for a service, but we expect value for money.","Owners need to spend some $$$ and update the rooms.

Floor full of staffs running around but no one to help to get a high chair for a kid. We even tried to speak with the floor manager, he indicated us that he will come back but he never did.",en

Our air conditioning would turn off randomly and we weren’t allowed to change the temperature on a 35 degree day. We paid extra for Breakfast included and when we checked in they told us that only one person was booked in per day which is very confusing as we came as a couple and we would never book to go alone to breakfast separately? The shower pressure was very poor and when we brought back food from another restaurant we asked if it could be heated up as we had a long walk back to the hotel and it went cold but we were told they weren’t allowed to as it could be contaminated from outside the hotel.",en

Otherwise the rest of breakfast was fine. Just annoyed we only found out once walking to the table we had to pay for the children that we thought were already included!","False advertising!!!!
The two rooms we booked stated on Bookings.com that it catered for enough people for us. One room was a twin the other was an extra king which said we had bedding for 2 adults + 1 child - but once paid for It an email was received saying both rooms were only for 2 people.  After speaking to you for 1.5hrs (our expense) Trying to sort this out before our arrival & needing to call the Philippine’s myself as Australia was closed on the weekend & hotel staff not being able to help either (your hotel staff said I must call bookings) I turned up to the Hotel & the extra bed I was asking for (which apparently had been organised on the 1.5hr call) wasn’t even organised with hotel staff. I had to call reception and get another bed sent up. Not to mention $75 extra we had to pay for as well that was never told to us - not even in fine print. Reception told us it was an interconnecting room only to find when we got inside it wasn’t that either. 
Also NOTHING was said in fine print about Children not being included in the breakfast - would of been nice to know before turning up for breakfast that we had to pay extra for 3 kids we had with us. Basically a waste of time calling & trying to organise the extra bed.

", 3.0 ,None,"This is yet another big hotel ""caching the fish"" by mainly using the false advertisement and worldwide reputation they established over the years, by using their name to build up the brand. Lots of photoshop, colorful and impressive pictures of the Darling Harbour - nothing really having to do with a real situation in the hotel, are used for the advertisement. The place itself is noisy due to the busy roads. Reception/Main entrance is not easily approachable due to poor traffic management. In the hotel, the carpet is mainly everywhere on the floor, even in the corridors. It is old and dirty. No fresh air coming in due to poor ventilation and dense high-rise around the building. Rooms are very dark, extremely small, not painted for at least a decade. The paint from the wooden applications is peeling off due to cheap work and probably a cost-saving attitude. Even the rooms have quite a bad odor given to the poor ventilation systems, old carpets & curtains, as well as cloths around the table lights, etc. The smell of mold and rotten wood next to the bed applications & wooden installations on the wall only enriches this flavor. Rooms were designed for the smokers prior to the imposed ban - they can't hide this, and they were never correctly refurbished. Could have been completely re-painted, including all the walls in the room and change the interior with money guests left them for the poor service they offer. Natural drinking water in the fridge will be charged an extra $3.00 for the non-members. Going to their restaurant - during the weekend you will have to wait in a long queue up to 20-40min to be seated. 60-70 people at least waiting in a queue to go-in & dine. In the Bar/Lounge there's usually a 5min waiting time in queue - whereas the attitude is ""help yourself, but give me a tip"". Coffee the guests ordered were forgotten to be served to the table 2 of 3 times in 3 days.",en
